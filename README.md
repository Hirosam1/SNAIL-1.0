# SNAIL-1.0
Working progress to upgrade the [previous Snail engine](https://github.com/Hirosam1/SNAIL).

The glm library is not used anymore and all vector-matrix operations are made by the program itself. It was also removed the BasibBlock class, that class was a very bad design decision. Also, many other design decisions were made to improve the quality of life.
