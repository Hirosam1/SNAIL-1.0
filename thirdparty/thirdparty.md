## Third-party

This folder contains all files not done by me, but instead headers of open source programs, that I use with the engine.

Those are:
- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
- [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)
- [nlohmann json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
- [stb image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
- [premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core)

Thank you for all devs of all those open source tools!
