## GameEngine

This is simply where all implementation of the game engine lies. I might have change the redundant name of "GameEngine" to something like mine engine e.g. "SnailEngine", but I fell to lazy for ir :P.

The files are mostly commented as for what each thing do.

Here you also have the premake file that will be called from the MyFiles folder. And it is also here where the libraries binaries will be generated.
